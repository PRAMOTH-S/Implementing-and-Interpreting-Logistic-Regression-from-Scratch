# Implementing-and-Interpreting-Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch
This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch using NumPy, including sigmoid activation, binary cross-entropy loss, and gradient descent optimization. The custom model is trained on synthetic data and evaluated against scikit-learn’s Logistic Regression, with performance comparison and coefficient interpretation.
